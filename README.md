# Online-Poker-Platform-Innovative-Card-Gaming-Experience

## Overview
Developed a web-based poker card game platform using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, offering users an engaging and interactive experience. The game allows players to enjoy the classic game of poker by dealing cards and determining the winner based on card power calculations. Additionally, the platform incorporates features such as card shuffling for randomness, customization of card powers, and the calculation of luck factors including mean, median, maximum, and minimum card powers for each player. This project showcases proficiency in web development technologies and demonstrates innovation in creating a dynamic gaming environment.

## InstallationTo run this poker card game on your local machine, follow these steps:

1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
2. Open the index.html file in your preferred web browser.


## Usage
## Usage
1. **Single Deal**: Click on the "Single Deal" button to deal cards for a single round. This option is suitable for quick games or practice sessions.
   
2. **Multi Deal**: Use the "Multi Deal" button to deal cards for multiple rounds. Enter the desired number of deals when prompted, and the game will automatically deal cards for the specified number of rounds. This feature is ideal for longer gaming sessions or tournaments.

3. **Change Card(s) Power**: Click on the "Change Card(s) Power" button to customize the power of individual cards. Adjust the power values for each card type according to your preferences. This allows for fine-tuning the game dynamics and introducing variations in gameplay.

4. **Playing the Game**: After dealing cards, observe the cards dealt to each player and their respective powers. Special sequences such as 'AAA', 'AA', and 'AKQ' provide bonus power, so keep an eye out for these combinations.

5. **Determining the Winner**: The winner is determined based on the highest total power accumulated from the dealt cards. The player with the most powerful combination of cards wins the round. The game automatically calculates and displays the winner at the end of each round.

6. **Exploring Luck Factors**: Take advantage of the luck factor calculations provided by the platform. Explore statistics such as mean, median, maximum, and minimum card powers for each player to gain insights into their performance and luck in the game.

7. **Enjoying the Experience**: Sit back, relax, and enjoy playing poker in a convenient and user-friendly online environment. Whether you're playing solo or with friends, this platform offers an immersive gaming experience that guarantees entertainment.

## Project Description
The Genomic Analysis Tool for SARS-CoV-2 Variants is a comprehensive project aimed at mastering key aspects of data science, including data downloading and cleaning, dataset setup, distance computation, dimensionality reduction, and data visualization. This project, involves two program scripts.

#### Program Script#1: Downloading and Pre-processing Data
Step 1 : Register on the GISAID site, following the instructions in the "Registration" tab. Account approval may take 24-48 hours.

Step 2 : Log in, navigate to the "EpiCoV" tab, and download SARS-CoV-2 sequences in "fasta" format. Apply filters for completeness, coverage, geographic origin, and variant type.

Step 3 : Process downloaded sequences for each variant, converting to uppercase, filtering recognized letters (A, C, G, T), and organizing them into individual .fasta files.

#### Program Script#2: Reading the Dataset and Visualization
Step 4 : Read individual .fasta files containing SARS-CoV-2 sequences.

Step 5 : Compute Chaos Game Representations (CGR) with k = 7 for each sequence, generating CGR plots.

Step 6 : Compute pairwise distances between CGRs, creating a symmetric distance matrix.

Step 7 : Utilize multi-dimensional scaling (MDS) for dimensionality reduction, creating a 3D plot to visualize relationships between data points.

## Achievements
This assignment was successfully completed using Python, incorporating libraries such as Biopython for sequence processing, Matplotlib for plotting, and Scikit-learn for MDS. The code includes optimized functions for reading sequences, generating CGR plots, computing distances, and visualizing relationships.
